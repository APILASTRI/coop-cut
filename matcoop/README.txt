In case you prefer MATLAB over Python, the unary potentials and edge classes
needed for cooperative cut segmentation can be pre-computed in MATLAB by the
included functions. Once pre-computed, these can be input to the `coopcut`
executable found in the `coop-cut` directory.

If you would like to contribute a MATLAB wrapper in the style of the Python
wrapper, we would welcome it!
